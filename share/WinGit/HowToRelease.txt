How to create a Windows Release
===============================

A setup executable is named as follows
 - it starts with Git;
 - followed by the official git version if the release is closely
   related to a specific version of official git;
 - followed by
    * preview<date>, for snapshot builds.
    * winrc#, if we reach a certain quality level and plan to release
      a stable version.  If no bugs are found, this can be upgraded
      to a stable release.  We use winrc instead of simply rc to avoid
      confusion with official release candidates.  The prefix "win"
      clearly indicates that the tag is about the Windows release.

Examples:

Git-preview20080313.exe
Git-1.5.4-preview20071014.exe
Git-1.5.4-winrc3.exe
Git-1.5.4.exe

We'll not necessary release a stable version for each official version
number. If we merge changes from git.git we will adjust the number.
We will continue releasing previews until we have reached sufficient
stability.

The following criteria should be met before we go stable.
    * features equivalent to official git-#-#-# are available in Git Bash.
    * [DONE] safe crlf handling.
    * good support for case insensitive filesystems.
    * [DONE] git-gui works if run from Git Bash.
    * [DONE] git-gui works if run from Start Menu.
    * [DONE] git and git-gui available from Windows Command Prompt (cmd shell).
    * server functionality (git-daemon, git-shell, ...) _not_ necessarily
      supported.
    * git-cheetah _not_ needed.

For now we should only release previews.

A release is created from official git.git plus a number of patches
that are not yet in upstream.  Since 1.6.0, most of the MinGW port is
included in Junio's official git.git.  A few patches, however, are not
yet included.  Those patches are maintained as a branch 'release' that
is regularily rebased onto Junio's master.  A msysgit release is
tagged by a tag having a postfix '-msysgit<number>'.

He are the step by step instructions for the maintainer:

   cd /git
   git fetch mingw
   git fetch junio
   git checkout devel
   git merge mingw/master
   git merge junio/master
   make -k test | tee test.log
   # check test.log
   git checkout release
   git rebase junio/master
   # check that differences between devel and release
   # are only trivial ones, i.e. tests, that do not
   # change the released binaries.
   make clean
   make install
   git push . devel:master  # should fast-forward
   git tag -a <version>-msysgit1

   cd /doc/git/html
   git fetch
   git checkout origin/html

   cd /share/WinGit
   git checkout devel
   start ReleaseNotes.rtf # edit and save
   git commit -a
   git push . devel:master
   git tag -a -m "Git-<version>" Git-<version>
   ./release.sh <version>

   # test installer
   # upload to Google code (verify sha1)
   cd /git
   git push
   cd /
   git push
   git push Git-<version>  # don't forget to push tag

   # reply to Junio's announcement.
   # The subject of your email should start with [ANNOUNCE].
