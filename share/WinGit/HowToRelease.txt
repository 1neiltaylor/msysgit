How to create a Windows Release
===============================

A setup executable is named as follows
- it starts with Git;
- followed by the official git.git version indicating the core features;
- followed by
    * preview<date>, for snapshot builds.
    * beta#, if we reached a certain quality level but know we're not
      ready for a stable release. For example testing is needed.
    * rc#, if there are no known issues. If no new bugs are found, this
      can be upgraded to a stable release.

Examples:

Git-1.5.3-preview20071014.exe
Git-1.5.3-beta1.exe
Git-1.5.3-rc1.exe
Git-1.5.3.exe

We'll not necessary reach a stable release for each official version
number. If we merge changes from git.git we will adjust the number.
For example, we might jump to WinGit-1.5.3.3-rc1 without ever releasing
WinGit-1.5.3. We should stay with preview/beta/rc until we have reached
sufficient stability.

We use the following criteria to decide if we go stable.
    * features equivalent to official git-#-#-# are available in Git Bash.
    * git-gui works if run from Git Bash.
    * git-gui works if run from Start Menu.
    * git and git-gui available from Windows Command Prompt (cmd shell).
    * server functionality (git-daemon, git-shell, ...) _not_ necessarily
      supported.
    * git-cheetah _not_ needed.

For now we should only release previews.
