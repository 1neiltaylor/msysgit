This is a loose list of things to do.  Please remove the items with the commit
that implements it.

- add a README

- add Start Menu, Desktop icon and Quick Launch to the WinGit installer

- find a reasonable method to start git-gui _not_ from the command line
  (maybe git-cheetah?)

- make WinGit installer more efficient by not including the builtins, and
  rather have install.tcl pick up a list of builtins it copies git.exe to

- move the msysgit specific scripts out of /bin/ into /share/<something>

- merge git.git's master into 4msysgit.git

- put the Git icon from henrik.nyh.se/2007/06/alternative-git-logo-and-favicon
  into the installers
