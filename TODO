This is a loose list of things to do.  Please remove the items with the commit
that implements it.

- add a README

- add Start Menu, Desktop icon and Quick Launch to the WinGit installer

- find a reasonable method to start git-gui _not_ from the command line
  (maybe git-cheetah?)

- make WinGit installer more efficient by not including the builtins, and
  rather have install.tcl pick up a list of builtins it copies git.exe to

- move the msysgit specific scripts out of /bin/ into /share/<something>

- merge git.git's master into 4msysgit.git

- put the Git icon from henrik.nyh.se/2007/06/alternative-git-logo-and-favicon
  into the installers
      GitMe installer: done

- find out why the default setting of "LESS" to "-FRSX" does not work

- feed the changes in 4msysgit.git to mingw.git or directly to git.git. This
  is a bit involved, as it means repackaging the whole diff between our master
  and Junio's master.  We might get away with rebasing step by step, i.e.
  replace each merge from upstream with a rebase.  Much work, no doubt.
